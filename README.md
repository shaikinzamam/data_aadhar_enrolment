# Aadhaar Enrolment Demand Analysis 📊

## 🏆 Hackathon Project

This project is part of a hackathon focused on analyzing Aadhaar enrolment data and estimating district-wise monthly service demand.  
The goal is to build a data pipeline that can support planning, forecasting, and digital service optimization.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Government enrolment systems handle millions of Aadhaar requests.  
To improve infrastructure planning, we need to:

- Understand enrolment trends  
- Aggregate data by district and month  
- Estimate service update demand  

This project processes raw Aadhaar enrolment data and generates a clean, structured dataset for further analytics and system development.
